Biostat 625 Homework #3

# Overview:
In this homework assignment, we need to develop an R package implementing an existing R function. Depending on the level of statistical and computational knowledge, I choose the linear regression model to work by the designed function named fit_model(), with the ordinary least squares method to minimize the prediction error, between the predicted and real values. 

# Example:
mymodel <- fit_model(aim_X = matrix_object, Y = vector_object)
